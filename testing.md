# Test Plan and Evidence / Results of Testing

## Game Description

The project involves the programming of a two-player game.

1. This is a 2-player game that involves a 20 square table and counters that the players have to move.  
2. The counters are labeled 'S' for Silver and 'G' for Gold, the table is a 20-square horizontal grid.  
3. The players move the counters to the left when it is their turn and have to make there move get the gold counter.
4. If one of the players gets the gold counter then that player has won the game and the other one loses.
5. Once one of the players have won, the game can either end or start-over.

## Test Plan

The following game features / functionality and player actions will need to be tested:

- Getting the player names.
- Showing the Grid and Counters.
- Getting the players move.
- Moving the counters around.
- Ending the game once one of the players wins the Gold.
- Ending the game once one of the players gets the Gold.

The following tests will be run against the completed game. The tests should result in the expected outcomes shown.

### Getting the Player Names

The code should tell the player that it wants their names.

#### Test Data / Actions to Use

The players must type in their name e.g. "Jayarn" and "Brian".

#### Expected Outcome

The game should use these names throughout the games progression.


### Showing the Grid and Counters

The game should setup the grid and show the counters in random positions.

#### Test Data / Actions to Use

Running the code many times to see if it works.

#### Expected Outcome

The grid should be shown with the Counters shown in random places in the grid.

The users types in the names and the system accepts them and uses them.


### Showing the grid and Counters

This video shows the grid and counters being formed:
